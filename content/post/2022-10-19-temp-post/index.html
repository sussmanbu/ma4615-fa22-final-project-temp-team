<p>I like data</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
<ul>
<li>Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?</li>
<li>What questions are you interested in answering?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breadth of the DA
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you ask enough initial questions to explore the different variables in your data.</li>
<li>i.e. Do you explore more than just one or two variables? Do you explore a few different relationships or many?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Depth of the DA
<ul>
<li>When you answer one question, usually more questions arise as well.</li>
<li>The depth of the DA is about coming up with and exploring the answers to these questions, often iterating the process a few times.</li>
<li>Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions? …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity Figures
<ul>
<li>Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?</li>
<li>Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clarity of Explanations
<ul>
<li>Do you introduce why you are doing each analysis?</li>
<li>How well do you explain each figure/result?</li>
<li>Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Organization and cleanliness.
<ul>
<li>Make sure to remove excessive warnings, use clean easy-to-read code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
